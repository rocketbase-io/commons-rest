Focus on tough problems and not on CRUD that the main focus of commons-rest. We [@rocketbase.io](https://www.rocketbase.io) develop many microservices and tried many tools and projects. All of them didn't matched our needs. By using for example [spring-data-rest](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/) you loose flexibility when you leave the basic path or by using [jHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/) you have a full blown setup with many dependencies. Commons-rest focus on CRUD and leaves flexibility to you as developer. Additionally we've crafted a yeoman [project and service generator](https://github.com/rocketbase-io/generator-spring-rest-commons) in order to write less code :)

The implementation bases on spring-boot: mainly on **spring-mvc** and **spring-data** 

We believe in separation of Entity and DTO. We go one step forward and separate also the DTO into Read (response structure) and Write (create/update structure). This has many advantages for example separation of concern and allow edit by reference id and response with object. Furthermore it improves readability.

Conversion between each object can be automatically generated with [mapstruct](http://mapstruct.org/) see sample-project for details.

**Features:**
* basic DTOs as per example a missing PageableResult
* custom RuntimeExceptions, ExceptionHandler and BeanValidationExceptions
* abstract CRUD controller also for parent child situations
* abstract CRUD resources to consume REST-Services 
* prodivded a [project and service generator](https://github.com/rocketbase-io/generator-spring-rest-commons) via yeoman
* provided a jwt security module that is simply pluggable name [commons-auth](https://github.com/rocketbase-io/commons-auth)

## documentation

Within the [wiki-pages](https://github.com/rocketbase-io/commons-rest/wiki) you can find some explanations to the different classes, helpers and dtos.

## module overview

### commons-rest-api

This module provides some useful runtime exceptions like NotFoundException and basic DTO classes. Mainly ErrorResponse for rending details to error and also field-validation exceptions (this is handled a BeanValidationExceptionHandler provided by rest-server) and PageableResult to provide results in a paged wrapper. Additionally, you can find abstract implements of resources to consume REST-Services within java-code by use of RestTemplate and Jackson.

### commons-rest-server

Containing ExceptionHandlers for common errors like BeanValidationExceptions or the custom NotFoundException. Abstract classes to implement CRUD SpringRestController. Also a parent child solution is provided.

### commons-errorpage

Simple designed error pages for 400, 401, 403, 404 and 500 error-codes.

### commons-rest-hashids

Implementation for obfuscatedId interface introduced within the api. Uses [hashids](https://hashids.org/java/) as library to obfuscate long ids.

| property                       | default         | explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| hashids.salt                   |                 | salt for hashIds                                             |
| hashids.minHashLength          | 8               | min length of hasid                                          |
| hashids.alphabet               | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 | alphabet of hashid (by default we've skipped uppercase)  |
| handler.obfuscatedDecode.enabled | true         | enable/disable ExceptionHandler for ObfuscatedDecodeException    |

## commons-rest-logging-aspect

Adds a RequestLoggingAspect that wraps around all RestController Mappings and loggs: method, path, parameter, duration...

```
GET /api/company üïì 61 ms ‚Æê find({}) ‚Æë PageableResult(totalElements=100, totalPages=4, page=0, pageSize=25, content=[CompanyRead(id=5dc3...
```

Furthermore you can annotate a Service Method with @Loggable and get a duration tracking as well. 
**It's only working on Services that are wrappable by aspect**. So you can only use it on Services calls from other services - no internal calls within the same Service.

```java
@Service
public class SampleService {

    @SneakyThrows
    @Loggable
    public void exampleService(Instant startExecution) {
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
    }
}
```
```
exampleService(2019-11-07T12:19:08.800Z) üïì 2 sec 9 ms
```

| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| commons.logging.mvc.enabled   | true           | in case you only want to use Loggable Method aspect - disable RestController aspect  |
| commons.logging.trim        | true           | trim result                                         |

| commons.logging.args        | false            | log each args.toString() with trimLength                                        |
| commons.logging.result        | false            | log result.toString() with trimLength                                 |
| commons.logging.query | true | add query parameter to url |
| commons.logging.logLevel        | DEBUG            | level to log a normal hit                                    |
| commons.logging.errorLogLevel        | WARN            | level to log an error hit                                   |


## commons-rest-sample

Sample spring-boot application to demonstrate the use of the provided commons-rest libraries. 

## configuration

This module uses the auto configuration feature of spring-boot-starter so that all necessary beans will get configured automatically.
Nevertheless you can customize the configuration by the following properties

| property                       | default         | explanation                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| locale.resolver.enabled        | true            | enable/disable default configuration of the LocaleResolver   |
| locale.resolver.default        | en              |                                                              |
| handler.badRequest.enabled     | true            | enable/disable ExceptionHandler for BadRequestException      |
| handler.notFound.enabled       | true            | enable/disable ExceptionHandler for NotFoundException        |
| handler.beanValidation.enabled | true            | enable/disable ExceptionHandler for MethodArgumentNotValidException (bean validation issues from spring-boot)      |
